\# Using the Prescription Analyzer



\### Step 1: Image Capture

For 99% accuracy, ensure:

\- The camera is parallel to the paper.

\- No "hotspot" reflections from overhead lights.

\- The entire edges of the paper are visible.



\### Step 2: Processing

The AI will segment the image into:

\- \*\*Header:\*\* Clinic/Doctor info.

\- \*\*Body:\*\* The Rx (Medications).

\- \*\*Footer:\*\* Signature and date.



\### Step 3: Verification

The system presents a "side-by-side" view. Users should verify the AI-extracted text against the original image before saving to their profile.



\### 📸 Best Practices for Scanning

\- \*\*Lighting:\*\* Use natural daylight if possible. Avoid harsh flashes that cause glare on glossy paper.

\- \*\*Flat Surface:\*\* Ensure the prescription is not crumpled or folded.

\- \*\*Angle:\*\* Hold the camera directly above the document (parallel).

\- \*\*Focus:\*\* Tap the screen to focus specifically on the handwritten medication names.



\### 🔄 The Extraction Process

1\. \*\*Upload:\*\* Select the image from your gallery or use the live camera.

2\. \*\*Review:\*\* The AI will highlight the text it has detected.

3\. \*\*Verify:\*\* You can manually edit any fields if the doctor's handwriting is exceptionally difficult to read.

4\. \*\*Save:\*\* Add the prescription to your "Medication Cabinet" for future reminders.
