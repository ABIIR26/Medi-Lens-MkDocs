\# Medi-Lens: AI-Powered Medical Intelligence 🩺







> \*\*Bridging the gap between complex medical documentation and patient understanding.\*\*



\*\*Medi-Lens\*\* is a cutting-edge healthcare solution that leverages Computer Vision and Medical Natural Language Processing (mNLP) to transform physical medical records into structured, actionable digital data.

\## 🛠 What is Medi-Lens?

Medi-Lens is built to solve the "last mile" problem in healthcare—ensuring that once a patient leaves the doctor's office, they have a clear, digital, and simplified understanding of their treatment plan and diagnostic results.

\## 🚀 How It Works

Medi-Lens follows a 4-step intelligence pipeline to ensure data integrity and clinical relevance.







1\.  \*\*Ingestion:\*\* The user uploads a photo of a prescription or lab report via the Next.js interface.

2\.  \*\*Transformation:\*\* Our Vision Transformer (ViT) model removes noise and digitizes handwritten text.

3\.  \*\*Analysis:\*\* The Medical NLP engine maps text to valid drug names (NDC) and lab benchmarks.

4\.  \*\*Insight:\*\* Users receive a simplified summary, safety alerts, and a digital history.
